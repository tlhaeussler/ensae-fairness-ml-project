# ensae-fairness-ml-project

## Overview
This repository is part of a university course project. The main component of this repository is a Jupyter notebook that explores the application of ROC-based fairness constraints in machine learning models, specifically within the context of bipartite ranking. The analysis is based on the methodology proposed by Vogel et al. (2021) in their paper "Learning Fair Scoring Functions: Bipartite Ranking under ROC-based Fairness Constraints.". Therefore, it is crucial to mention that major parts of the code are taken from the authors' repository and used here in an adapted way.

## Installation
To set up your environment to run this notebook:
1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install Jupyter by running `pip install jupyterlab`.
3. Clone this repository to your local machine.
4. Navigate to the cloned directory and install required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
To run the notebook:
1. Open your command line interface.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Start JupyterLab.
4. Open the `fairness_ranking.ipynb` file in the Jupyter interface.
5. It is necessary that the data and the models folder are available in the same directory as the notebook.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- JupyterLab
- See `requirements.txt` for a full list of required packages.
