# ensae-fairness-ml-project

## Overview
This repository is part of a university course project. The main component of this repository is a Jupyter notebook that explores the application of ROC-based fairness constraints in machine learning models, specifically within the context of bipartite ranking. The analysis is based on the methodology proposed by Vogel et al. (2021) in their paper "Learning Fair Scoring Functions: Bipartite Ranking under ROC-based Fairness Constraints.". Therefore, it is crucial to mention that major parts of the code are taken from the authors' repository and used here in an adapted way.

## Usage
To set up your environment to run this notebook:
1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Make sure you have the required packages installed. See on top of the Jupyter Notebook in the root directory.
4. It is necessary that the data and the models folder are available in the same directory as the notebook.

## Runtime
It took me approx. 1h 30min to run the entire notebook. However, this time can be reduced significantly by leaving out the experiments with the different monitoring points (see section 1.9 of the notebook).
